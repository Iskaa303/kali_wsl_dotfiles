# Nushell Environment Setup for Kali WSL

This project sets up a modern terminal environment using:

- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

It works for both the current user and root in Kali Linux WSL.
